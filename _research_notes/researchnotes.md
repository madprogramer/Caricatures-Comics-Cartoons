# Research Notes:


## French Caricature:

### Era: 1836-1848

* CORE:
* Authored by Intelligentsia
* Idealogy: Republican, Radical
* Attacks Laws: Monarchy, Outlawed Dissent and Censorship
* Friendly IG: Rural Folk, Trade Unions?
* Opposed IG: Bourgeoisie, Industrialists, Devout
*
* 
* IDEAS: 
* Charles Philipon could be a potential IG leader through event.
* France should get a journal entry on how to negotiate with them
	- Journal Entry will trigger modifiers for increasing Intelligentsia clout at the expense of opposed IGs.
	- Government can try to suppress at the risk of incurring emigrations and turmoil.
		+ Carucaturists themselves should NOT lead revolutions in the early game. 
	- This modifier may then spread to other countries
		+ Affected countries should also unlock a similar journal entry chain.
* Attitude after 1848 is very difficult to predict without studying history
